Hi all,

You need to copy the burpsuite jar file in this folder.
This file is called something like burpsuite_pro_v1.3.07.jar or burpsuite_v1.3.03.jar

Please note that I haven't done a lot of testing, and most of the testing has been done with Linux and very little with Windows.

Please send me a mail if you have any question: david@ombrepixel.com

Cheers,
David Robert
